In the past year, we have seen so many open source machine learning models being released. From Stable Diffusion to Llama2, the open source world is thriving. 

At Drip, we believe that AI should be built in the open and available for everyone. However, even though models are open source, the technical knowledge to use machine learning models is still a high hurdle to cross.

Therefore, we believe that high quality tools to use AI models should also be open source and available for all. ComfyUI is currently the gold standard for developing gen AI image and video capabilities. However, there are still many areas of improvement that Drip wishes to support and contribute to. 

## Empower everyone with any level of technical ability to use ComfyUI. 

ComfyUI can be hard to set up for people who are not used to installing python packages or using git. 

## Develop Comfy to be suitable for large-scale deployment.

Although most users use Comfy on their personal machine, there are many enterprises using Comfy to power their apps used by millions of users. We aim to improve reliability of deploying Comfy by adding versioning with backwards compatibility, integration tests with every release, and automated testing for various deployment environments (including different types of GPUs).
