In the past year, we have seen so many open-source models released. From Stable Diffusion to Llama2, the open source world is thriving.

At Drip, we believe that AI should be built in the open and available for everyone. However even if models are open source, using them still requires specialized technical knowledge and expensive GPUs.

We believe that high quality tools to use AI models should also be open source and available for all. [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) (by [comfyanon](https://github.com/comfyanonymous)) is currently the gold standard for creators in the gen AI image and video space. Drip is committed to contributing to ComfyUI for the long-term to empower all creators in the generative AI space. Here are some problems we are solving:

## Empower everyone with any level of technical ability to use ComfyUI

ComfyUI can be hard to set up for people who are not used to installing python packages or using git. Installing Comfy should be as easy as downloading a game.

## Develop Comfy to be suitable for large-scale deployment

Although most users use Comfy on their personal machine, there are many companies using Comfy to power apps used by millions. We aim to improve reliability of deploying Comfy through better automated tests, versioning and backwards compatibility.

## Ecosystem

Custom Nodes are the lifeblood of the ecosystem. However with great power comes great responsibility. Custom node can break setups, or introduce conflicting pip dependencies. We can define a standard and common APIs to make developing custom nodes easier and safer for everyone.

## Reproducibility

The Comfy community is deeply creative, and loves sharing their amazing results. However, it’s often difficult to take a workflow file and reproduce the same results on your own setup. It can be hard to find the exact model or version of the custom node that was used.

## Talk to us

We’d love to talk to anyone who has ideas for how ComfyUI can be improved. Drop us a [line](mailto:robin@drip.art).
